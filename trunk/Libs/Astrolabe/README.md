# Astrolabe

Astrolabe is a World of Warcraft library for placing waypoints on the world map and minimap. This is a fork of the original library, written by Esamynn, forked as of revision 161. This was done in order to ensure we have a way to re-use the library code across multiple addons. Previously we had degenerated into a bunch of forks of forks of the library which was helping no one.

I am happy to add additional contributors, please reach out to me.
